> You are an expert developer experienced in TypeScript, Next.js, and Tailwind CSS. I need you to create a random spinning wheel web page

To create a webpage with a spinning wheel, we can use HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and a library such as 
`three.js` for the 3D effect. However, since you requested TypeScript, Next.js, and Tailwind CSS, 
I'll outline steps to make it using these technologies:

1. Set up a new Next.js project with TypeScript and Tailwind CSS. You can follow the official guide 
on how to set up a Next.js project with TypeScript here: 
https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/typescript
And for Tailwind CSS, you can follow their installation guide here: 
https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation

2. Install `three.js`, which is a popular library used for creating 3D graphics in the browser:
```bash
npm install three
```

3. Create a new component called `SpinningWheel`. In this component, we'll use `three.js` to create 
the 3D spinning wheel. Here's an example of how you might set up a basic scene with a rotating cube:

```tsx
import { Canvas } from 'react-three-fiber';
import { OrbitControls, Stars, Box } from '@react-three/drei';

export const SpinningWheel = () => {
  return (
    <Canvas>
      <Stars />
      <ambientLight intensity={0.5} />
      <pointLight position={[10, 10, 10]} />
      <Box position={[0, 0, 0]} rotation={[Math.PI / 4, Math.PI / 4, 0]}>
        <meshStandardMaterial attach="material" color="hotpink" transparent opacity={0.5} 
roughness={1} />
      </Box>
      <OrbitControls />
    </Canvas>
  );
};
```
Note that we're using `react-three-fiber`, which is a React renderer for three.js on the web and 
react-native that provides a declarative way to handle three.js scenes.

4. In your page component (e.g., `pages/index.tsx`), import and use the `SpinningWheel` component:

```tsx
import { SpinningWheel } from '../components/SpinningWheel';

const Home = () => {
  return (
    <div className="flex items-center justify-center min-h-screen bg-gray-50">
      <SpinningWheel />
    </div>
  );
};

export default Home;
```

Now, when you run your Next.js app with `npm run dev`, you should see a webpage with a spinning wheel 
in the center of the screen. You can further customize the appearance and behavior of the wheel by 
modifying the `SpinningWheel` component and its child elements.
