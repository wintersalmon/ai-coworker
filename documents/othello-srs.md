# Othello Game Requirements Specification

## 1. Overview
This specification outlines the rules and requirements for developing the Othello game. Othello is a strategic game played on an 8x8 board where two players take turns placing discs and flipping the opponent's discs.

## 2. Game Start Conditions
1. **Initial Disc Placement**: The game starts with 4 discs placed in the center of the board in an alternating pattern. The initial placement is as follows:
   - D4: White disc
   - E5: White disc
   - D5: Black disc
   - E4: Black disc

## 3. Disc Placement Rules
1. **Capturing Discs**: A player must place their disc in a position where it will capture one or more of the opponent's discs. 
   - Capturing can occur in horizontal, vertical, or diagonal directions.
   - When a disc is placed, all opponent's discs that are flanked between the new disc and another of the player's discs are flipped to the player's color.

2. **Passing Turns**: If a player has no valid moves to capture the opponent's discs, their turn is automatically passed to the opponent.

## 4. Game End Conditions
The game ends when one of the following conditions is met:
1. **Board Full**: All 64 squares on the board are filled with discs.
2. **One Color Remaining**: One player has flipped all of the opponent's discs, leaving only their own color on the board.
3. **Both Players Pass**: Both players pass their turns consecutively because no valid moves are available.

## 5. Winning Conditions
1. The player with the most discs on the board at the end of the game wins.
2. If both players have the same number of discs, the game is a draw.

## 6. Board and Interface Requirements
1. **Game Board**: The game board should be an 8x8 grid.
2. **Disc Display**: Clearly distinguish between black and white discs.
3. **Current Turn Indicator**: Display which player's turn it is clearly.
4. **Score Display**: Show the current score for both players in real-time.
5. **Game End Notification**: When the game ends, display the winner and the final scores.

## 7. Additional Feature Requirements
1. **Invalid Move Notification**: Notify the player if they attempt to place a disc in an invalid position and automatically pass the turn if no valid moves are available.
2. **Restart Game**: Provide an option to restart the game after it ends.
3. **Undo Move**: Each player should have the option to undo their last move once per game.

This specification provides the foundational guidelines for developing the Othello game. Developers should adhere to these guidelines to ensure a consistent and fair gameplay experience. Additional features and rules may be incorporated as necessary during the development process.
